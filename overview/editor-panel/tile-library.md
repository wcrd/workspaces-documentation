# Tile Library

The Tile Library can be accessed from the right hand side panel as pictured below. The Tile Library contains all Tiles that are available to use on the workspace and is broken up into the following sections:

* **Search Bar**: search for tiles by name
* **Recently Used**: recent history of the last six tiles used
* **Core**: the core set of Tiles provided by Switch for Workspaces. It is further broken into:
  * **Charts**: standard charting tiles
  * **Data**: tiles designed to showcase data (think tables, labels, statuses, etc)
  * **Slicers**: tiles designed to filter other tiles or accept user input
  * **Display Elements**: tiles designed to add static visuals or text to a workspace
  * **Others**: any other tiles that don't fit into the above categories
* **Additional**: This section contains specialist tiles - tiles that are designed for a particular use case or feature.
