# Configure the Tile

After creating our Tile we need to configure it. Configuring the Tile involves selecting the Data Source that the Tile will use, and setting up how that data will look on the Tile. We will cover of each stage in this section.

## Tile Configuration (Data Bindings) Overview

Every tile has the following configuration sections (data bindings):

* **Properties**
* **Data Source**
* **Tile Setup**

Using these three sections we can configure any tile in the workspace library.
