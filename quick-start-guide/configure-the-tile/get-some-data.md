# ðŸŸ¡ Get some data

Get data using pre-made query function.

Workspaces is still being developed, beautiful abstractions are coming, but for now we need to use these functions to grab data.

Think of most of these like Excel Pivot tables. We have a couple of parameters we want to filter and group (aggregate) by, and we want to see either live data or historical data.

The process we went through is the same process needed to set up any tile from our library. Please see Walkthrough for a full example of setting up a basic workspace.
