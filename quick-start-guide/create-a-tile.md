# Create a Tile

## Drag & Drop

Adding a Tile to the workspace is as simple as dragging it from the Tile Library and dropping it onto the Canvas. Further detail is provided below.

### Select a Tile from the Library

The Tile Library can be accessed from the right hand side panel as pictured below. The Tile Library is broken up into the following sections:

* **Search Bar**: search for tiles by name
* **Recently Used**: recent history of the last six tiles used
* **Core**: the core set of Tiles provided by Switch for Workspaces. It is further broken into:
  * **Charts**: standard charting tiles
  * **Data**: tiles designed to showcase data (think tables, labels, statuses, etc)
  * **Slicers**: tiles designed to filter other tiles or accept user input
  * **Display Elements**: tiles designed to add static visuals or text to a workspace
  * **Others**: any other tiles that don't fit into the above categories
* **Additional**: This section contains specialist tiles - tiles that are designed for a particular use case or feature.

Creating a new Tile is as simple as dragging and dropping on the Canvas.

Notice that after a Tile has been created the right hand side panel automatically switches to show the configuration settings (data bindings) for that Tile. This is explored in detail in the following section.
