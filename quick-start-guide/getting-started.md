# Getting started

## Introduction

This Quick Start Guide provides a high level overview on getting started with Workspaces. It will explain the basic concepts and help you to get data on a workspace fast. We will walk through:

1. [Creating a Workspace](create-a-workspace.md)
2. [Creating Tiles](create-a-tile.md)
3. [Getting Data](configure-the-tile/get-some-data.md)

At the completion of this Quick Start Guide you will have a basic workspace.

The remainder of this documentation covers off the workspaces tool in depth, and is highly recommended reading to get the most out of your workspaces.

## Basic Concepts

Before we get started lets cover off a couple of basic concepts. Workspaces are comprised of two key components: **Tiles **& **Data sources. **Workspaces are made up of **Tiles**, and every **Tile **needs a **Data source**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Workspaces are made up of **Tiles**. Every **Tile** has a **Data Source**.
{% endhint %}

### Tiles

Tiles are drag and drop visualizations for your workspaces. Switch maintains a large library of tiles; some commonly used ones are: Bar Chart, Sensor Tile, Text Tile, Grid, Combo Box, etc.

### Data sources

Data sources return filtered building data in an expected format. Data sources can be premade **Query Functions **or **Custom Queries.**

{% hint style="info" %}
For most use cases it is recommended to use our premade **Query Functions**
{% endhint %}

#### **Query Functions**

Query Functions are pre-made data sources that a user can easily configure in the workspace. They are provided by the Workspaces tool and allow us to quickly filter data we need for a tile.

#### Custom Queries

Custom Queries are exactly what they sound like: custom data sources that are written by the User. These are more advanced than Query Functions and will not be covered in the Quick Start guide. See [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") for more info.

## Next Steps

Now that we know the _**basic concepts**_ of how a workspace is setup, lets create one.
