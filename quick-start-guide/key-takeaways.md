# Key Takeaways

## **Use pre-made Query functions where possible.** 

Most standard dashboards should be fine using query functions. Using standardized functions will: 

* Reduce errors
* Simplify your dashboards
* Speed up your workflows \(no need to use datasets\)
* Reduce management time \(datasets does not need to be checked\)

Custom queries will make dashboards harder to maintain for others and pollute datasets with unnecessary queries. Only use them for special aggregations and custom functions.
