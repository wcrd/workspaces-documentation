# Workspace Type

## Overview

Workspaces have two _**Style Types:**_

| Style Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Screen** | <p>Workspace is designed to be viewed on a screen.<br>The workspace has a number of <a data-mention href="scaling.md">scaling.md</a> modes to support any screen type and design case. </p> |
| **Report** | <p>Workspace is designed to be printed to a PDF (or sheet of paper).<br>The workspace supports the user in creating a report that will fit perfectly on their chosen paper size.</p>        |

## Style Types

The workspace style type is set in the Workspace Settings bindings panel through the _**'Style Type'**_ field.

### Screen

This style type is designed to be viewed live through a screen.

A number of sizing and scaling options are available to the user. See [scaling.md](scaling.md "mention") for more information.

### Report

A report style workspace is designed to be printed to a fixed area; e.g. PDF or paper.

Currently two sizes are supported:

1. A4 (ISO)
2. Letter (US)

The workspace report size can be chosen in the Workspace Settings binding panel using the 'Resolution' binding once a 'Report' workspace style has been selected.

The workspace canvas will show the allowable margins for the given size, and will automatically grow vertically to allow for multiple pages.

To save the report to a PDF (or print), use the 'Download' option in the workspace header.
