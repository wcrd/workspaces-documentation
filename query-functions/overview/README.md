# Overview

Query functions are prebuilt dataset queries \(or other API endpoints\) that return data in a set format based on the provided parameters.

Query functions are applicable for most standard queries, and are recommended as it reduces the need of the user to write custom datasets for everything.

It is useful to define query functions by the shape of the data they return: Narrow vs. Wide \([Wide vs. Narrow data](wide-vs.-narrow-data.md)\). Different tiles require data in these formats, and it helps to know which format each query produces.
