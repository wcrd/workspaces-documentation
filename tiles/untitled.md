# Overview

## Core Tile Concepts

### Setup

As described in [editor-layout](../overview/editor-panel/editor-layout/ "mention"), each and every tile has the following Data Bindings:

* **Properties**
* **Data Source**
* **Tile Setup**

Using these three sections we can configure any tile in the workspace library.

### Naming

As well as the core Data Bindings detailed above, every tile also exposes a 'Tile Name' field. This is the name that other tiles can use to see the data that this tile contains. It is important that every tile has a unique name to ensure consistent workspace behaviour.

Tile names **MUST** be unique.
